# Acuity Dependent Staffing Matrix 

A web application for hospitals to configure Q4 staffing needs based on individual patient acuity. The purpose of this app is to increase safety and employee burn out that is a result of incorrect staffing ratios. As it stands, hospitals staff their units based on patient census, the number of patients, rather than the acuity of each individual patient. An acuity score measures several factors that may or may not make a patient more difficult such as if your patient were intubated. In a perfect world, our progressing patients transfer up to a higher level of care where they can be provided more 1:1 care, however, that usually is bottlenecked for hours until a bed is open. This has become more common today as COVID has maxed ICU capacities. By factoring acuity into the staffing matrix we are able to produce more accurate staffing needs. Moreover, this tool has the potential to reduce costs within the hospital as staffing can feel more confident sending employees home on callback pay when the acuity is low.

## My process

### Built with

- React
- SASS
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

TBD upon completion. 

### Continued development

This application could be scaled up in many ways. 
- employee login portal
- populate patients from a secure database
- add addition acuity factors such as Post-operation, hospice, drains, diabetic
- add a feature for creating a staff members assignment. 
  For example, you select an assignment for a specific type of staff memeber and the matrix will provide X amount of patients that do not exceed a maximum total acuity score. This would eliminate Charge Nurses having to write each staff members assignment equally every shift, something that can be time consuming and erroneous.
